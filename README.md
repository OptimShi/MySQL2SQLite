# MySQL2SQLite
Converts a MySQL Database to SQLite, specifically for use with the Asheron's Call Emulator database https://github.com/ACEmulator/ACE-World-16PY-Patches

There i noo reason for this not to work with any other database, though it may need additional column datatype definitions/conversions.

For simplicitiy sake, this tool currently strips all comments and indexes.
